SaaS is considered p art of cloud computing since the software is hosted on the \\nInternet, or the “cloud.” Since  our SaaS applications are acces sed from a remote server rather than installed on individual \\nmachines, it is easier to maintain. For example, when the remot e software is updated, the customer’s interface is also \\nupdated for all users. Cloud computing is designed to eliminate  incompatibilities between differ ent software versions and \\nallow us to make incremental updates without requiring software  downloads. Additionally, our customers can save data to \\na central online location, which is designed to allow increased  project collaboration. As part of these services, we also \\ntypically provide hosted management services for the software a nd the customer’s data stored in our cloud. These services \\ninclude environment set-up and configuration, system health mon itoring, data integration maintenance, integration \\nmonitoring, system updates, security, and data upload/download,  and license administration. \\nSoftware Related Services  – We provide software maintenance and support (“M&S”), data ma nagement services, \\nvarious value-added services (“VAS”) to install, configure, or create analysis templates, and other professional services to \\nachieve customers’ specific outcomes using our software. We cal l this last type of services our solutions offering and, in \\nthese cases, we tailor the use of  one or more Exensio products to achieve a desired result. For example, our AIM \\nYieldAware™ FDC solution offering is designed to identify the p rocess control variables that have the greatest impact on \\nproduct yield through professional services that analyze the da ta from both Exensio Proce ss Control and elements of \\nExensio Manufacturing Analytics and make recommendations for th e customer to implement. VAS are provided by our \\nprofessional service personnel w ith expertise that enhances and  complements the engineering teams at our customers. For \\nexample, VAS includes our data cleaning and monitoring services . One requirement of big data analytics is to have clean, \\nharmonized data to analyze. This service offering outsources th e data wrangling and management effort to free the \\ncustomer to focus their efforts on analysis, which has a greate r ROI to the company than data management. \\nCharacterization Services  – These services are designed to characterize key product and/ or process elements, \\nprimarily into CV test structures  or DFI on-chip measurement in struments, and typically do not include performance ' metadata={'source': '/home/kings/7 projects/Tradingbot/data/finance_data.pdf', 'page': 11}\n",

We provid e these services, typically together with all elements of \\nour CV system, to foundry customers in connection with new proc ess technology development and/or yield ramp. In \\nCharacterization engagements, we generally provide the analysis  of our CV test chips and provide summary findings and \\nrecommendations to the customer. Characterization engagements c an include DFI systems. \\nCustomers \\nOur existing customers include f oundries, IDMs, fabless semicon ductor design companies, OSATs, equipment \\nmanufacturers, EMS, and ODMs, including those that embed and di stribute our Assembly Operations modules in their \\nequipment. Our semiconductor customers’ targeted product segmen ts vary significantly, including microprocessors, \\nmemory, graphics, image sensor solutions, and communications. W e believe that the adoption of our solutions by such \\ncompanies for usage in a wide range of products validates the a pplication of our solutions to the broader semiconductor \\nmarket. We often have multiple contracts with a single customer  or customer group, with no in terdependent performance \\nobligations. In general, our customer contracts are non-cancell able. \\nOne customer accounted for 35% of  our revenues for 2023, two cu stomers accounted for 41% of our revenues for \\n2022 and two customers accounted for 27% of our revenues for 20 21. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of \\nour revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021. Also, two customers accoun ted for 50% of our gross accounts receivable as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, and three cust omers accounted for 53% of our  gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022. \\nWe generally do not require collateral or other security to sup port accounts receivable. See the discussion in “Risk Factors” \\nunder Item 1A for more information about risks associated with customer concentration and contractual provisions. \\nInternational revenues accounted for approximately 44%, 50% and  55% of our total revenues for 2023, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively. We base these calculations on the geographi c location of where the work is performed or where the \\ncustomer is located. Revenues from customers by geographic area  based on the location of the customers’ work sites for \\nthe last three fiscal years can be  found in Note 11, “Customer and Geographic Information” to the consolidated financial \\nstatements. Additional discussion  regarding the risks associate d with international operations can be found under Item 1A, \\n“Risk Factors”. \\nSee our “Notes to Consolidated F inancial Statements”, included under Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data” for additional geographic information. \\nSales and Marketing \\nOur sales strategy is primarily  to pursue targeted accounts thr ough a combination of our direct sales force, our service \\nteams, and strategic alliances. After we are engaged by a custo mer and early in the services p rocess, our engineers seek to \\nestablish relationships in the organization and gain an underst anding of our customers’ business issues. Our direct sales \\nand service teams combine their efforts to deepen our customer relationships by expanding our penetration across \\ncustomers’ products, processes, and technologies. This close wo rking relationship with each customer has the added \\nbenefit of helping us to identify new product areas and technol ogies in which we should next focus our research and \\ndevelopment efforts. From time-to -time, we use sales representa tives/agents in various locations to augment direct sales \\nin certain territories.  \\nWe expect to continue to establish strategic alliances with pro cess licensors, vendors in the electronic design \\nautomation software, capital equipment for IC production, and t est silicon IP and mask-making s oftware segmen ts to create \\nand take advantage of sales channel and co-marketing opportunit ies. Additionally, we expect to form relationships with \\nkey value chain participants, including foundries and OSATs, to  provide services and value across the manufacturing \\nsupply chain. \\nResearch and Development \\nOur research and development focuses on developing and introduc ing new proprietary technologies for our \\ncomprehensive platform, including our Exensio software, Cimetri x connectivity and control products, and DFI and CV \\nsystems, as well as other software products and enhancements to  our existing solutions, such as field applications for DFI ' metadata={'source': '/home/kings/7 projects/Tradingbot/data/finance_data.pdf', 'page': 12}\n",

We use a rapid-prototyping \\nparadigm in the context of the customer engagement to achieve t hese goals. We have made, and expect to continue to \\nmake, substantial investments in research and development. The complexity of our technologies requires expertise in \\nstandards, physical IC design and layout, transistor design and  semiconductor physics, semiconductor process integration, \\nnumerical algorithms, e-beam tech nology, hardware, statistics a nd software development. We believe that our team of \\nengineers will continue to advance our market and technological  leadership. We conduct in-house training for our \\nengineers in certain technical ar eas. Our training also extends  to focusing on ways to enhance customer service skills. \\nAlthough it fluctuates, we can have up to one quarter of our re search and development engineers assigned to one or more \\nprojects, partnered with solutio n services engineers, in a deli berate strategy to provide direct feedback between technology \\ndevelopment and customer needs. We also utilize a variety of sk illed independent contractors for specialized development. \\nCompetition \\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and driven by rapidly changing design and process technologies, \\nevolving standards, short product life cycles, and decreasing p rices. We expect market competition to continue to develop \\nand increase as the market for data and analytics continues to evolve. We believe IC companies benefit from a combination \\nof big data management infrastructure, AI/ML-based analytics en gines, and products that generate and collect \\ndifferentiated data that enrich the analytics process. Currentl y, we are a leading provider o f comprehensive commercial \\nhardware, software and IP solutions for optimizing and improvin g design, manufacturing and test operations processes \\nthrough the application of differentiated data and advanced ana lytics. As a result, we face c ompetition from three primary \\ngroups: internal customer development or design programs, equip ment solutions providers, and providers of analytical and \\ndesign software. We face indir ect competition from internal gro ups at IC companies that offer tools with varying degrees \\nof optimization to accelerate pr ocess-design integration or tes t operations. Some providers of semiconductor \\nmanufacturing software, inspection equipment, electronic design  automation, or design IP may seek to broaden their \\nproduct offerings and compete with us. In addition, companies p roviding general ML and analytics software may focus on \\nsemiconductor companies and comp ete with us. In each of the mar ket segments we compete in, we face competition from \\nestablished and potential competitors, some of whom may have gr eater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing \\nand marketing resources than we have. \\nWe currently face indirect compe tition from the i nternal groups  at IC companies and direct competition from providers \\nof (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA Corporation (“KLA”), Siemens AG (“Siemens”), Onto \\nInnovation, Inc. (“Onto”), and Synopsys, Inc. (“Synopsys”); (ii ) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied \\nMaterials, Inc (“Applied Materials”), Synopsys, Invantest, Inc. , Emerson Electric Co., Onto,  and Siemens; (iii) inline \\ninspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as ASML Holding N.V. (“ASML”), Applied Materials, \\nKLA, and Keysight Technologies, Inc.; and, (iv) connectivity so ftware or integration products/services supporting factory \\nequipment connectivity or control needs of customers, such as P E E R  G r o u p ,  I n c . ,  K o n t r o n  A I S ,  G m b H ,  Y o k o g a w a  \\nElectric Corp., Advantest, and Kornic Automation Co. Ltd. There  may be other providers of competitive commercial \\nsolutions of which we are not aware, and we may compete with th e products or offerings of these named companies or \\nadditional companies if we expa nd our offerings through acquisi tions or development. For example, since our acquisition \\nof Cimetrix in late 2020, we now face competition in the produc ts/services supporting the connectivity, control and \\nintegration of factory equipment. The demand for solutions that  address the need for better integration between the silicon \\ndesign and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competi tors to enter our market. For example, in 2020, two of \\nour competitors were acquired by larger entities, Synopsys acqu ired Qualtera and NI, Inc. acquired Optimal+, and each \\nhas increased marketing or pricing competition with us. For exa mple, in 2023, Emerson Electric Co. acquired NI, Inc. This \\ncompetition in our market may intensify in the future, which co uld lead to increased pricing pressure, negatively impacting \\nour revenues, and slow our ability to grow or execute our strat egy. Also, our current and potential customers may choose \\nto develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we a re slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet \\nmarket needs. These and other competitors may be able to operat e  w i t h  a  l o w e r  c o s t  s t r u c t u r e  t h a n  o u r  e n g i n e e r i n g  \\norganization, which would give any such competitor’s products a  competitive advantage over our solutions. \\nWe believe that our solutions compare favorably with respect to  competition because we have demonstrated results \\nand reputation, strong core technology, ability to create innov ative technology, and ability to implement solutions for new \\ntechnology and product generations. See the discussions in “Ris k Factors” under Item 1A for more information about risks \\nassociated with our competition.

Some of th ese risks are highlighted in \\nthe following discussion, and in M anagement’s Discussion and An alysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \\nLegal Proceedings, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures  About Market Risk. The occurrence of any of these risks \\nor additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially  \\nand adversely affect our business, operating results, financial  condition, and stock price. These risks and uncertainties \\ncould cause our actual results to differ materially from the re sults contemplated by the forward-looking statements \\ncontained in this report. Investors should carefully consider a ll relevant risks and uncertainties before investing in our \\ncommon stock. \\nRisk Factors Summary \\nRisks Associated with Our Business \\n• We have invested significant resources into research and develo pment of our DFI system and Exensio software \\nand if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives on t he expected timeline or at all, our business, financial \\ncondition, or results of operati ons could be adversely impacted . \\n• Our sales cycle is lengthy and customers may delay entering int o contracts or decide not to adopt our products or \\nsolutions after we have performed services or supported their e valuation of our technology, which could result in \\ndelays in recognizing revenue and could negatively impact our r esults of operations in a quarter or result in lower \\nrevenue than we expected if a contract is not consummated. \\n• We rely on sole-source providers for certain software as well a s for specialized parts for our eProbe hardware and \\nsupply-chain delays or disrupti ons could increase our costs or impact our ability to provide complete software \\nsolutions or to build additional hardware tools or meet custome r expectations or deadlines, which could result in \\nlost sales and lower earnings. \\n• Our fixed-fee services for product or system installations/conf igurations may take longer than budgeted, which \\ncould slow our revenue recognition and may result in a lost con tract or a claim of breach by our customers, which \\nwould negatively affect our fin ancial and operating results. \\n• Our ability to sell our products , systems, and solutions depend s in part on the quality of our support and services \\nofferings, and the failure to offer high-quality support and se rvices could negatively affect our sales and results \\nof operations. \\n• Defects in our proprietary technologies, hardware and software tools, and failure to effectively remedy any such \\ndefects could decrease our revenue and our competitive market s hare. \\n• Objectionable disclosure of our customers’ confidential informa tion or our failure to comply with our customers’ \\nsecurity rules, including for those related to SaaS access, AI use, or our on-site access, could result in costly \\nlitigation, cause us to lose existing and potential customers, or negatively impact on-going business with existing \\ncustomers. \\n• We generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limite d number of customers, and a large percentage of \\nour revenues from one customer, so defaults or decreased busine ss with, or the loss of, any one of these customers, \\nor pricing pressure, or customer consolidation could significan tly reduce our revenues or margins and negatively \\nimpact results o f operations. \\n• If we do not continuously meet our development milestones of ke y research and development projects or \\nsuccessfully commercialize our DFI system, our future market op portunity and revenues will suffer, and our costs \\nmay not be recouped. ' metadata={'source': '/home/kings/7 projects/Tradingbot/data/finance_data.pdf', 'page': 17}\n",
      "8 page_content='Table of Contents \\n17 • We are required to comply with governmental export and import r equirements that could subject us to liability \\nand restrict our ability to sell our products and services, whi ch could impair our ability to compete in international \\nmarkets. \\n• Decreases in wafer volumes at our customers’ manufacturing site s or the volume of ICs that some of our \\ncustomers are able to sell to the ir customers would cause our I ntegrated Yield Ramp revenue to suffer. \\n• We acquired an early-stage battery-solutions provider and have been investing in research and development for \\nnew products and services beyond our traditional semiconductor focus, and it could take a long time to reach \\nmarket acceptance and recoup our costs, if at all. \\n• Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and ma nage our resources and restructure our business \\nthrough rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions, whi ch actions may have an adverse effect on our \\nfinancial and operating results. \\n• Our business may be negatively im pacted by social, political, g eopolitical, economic instability, unrest, war, \\nterrorism, or other circumstances that could interrupt our busi ness operations, which could cause us to lose sales \\nor delay or be unable to fulfill contractual commitments, which  may have an adverse effect on our financial and \\noperating results. \\n• Global economic conditions or semiconductor market conditions c ould materially adversel y impact demand for \\nour products and services, decrease our sales, or delay our sal es cycle. \\n• We face challenges in providing a  comprehensive s olution outsid e of the semiconductor industry due to \\nlimitations on the business areas in which we can use current t hird-party licensed technology, which may make \\nit prohibitively expensive to se ll our solution for application s outside of our traditional industry. \\nRisks Related to Our Technology \\n• If we fail to protect our IP rights, customers or potential com petitors may be able to use our technologies to \\ndevelop their own solutions, which could weaken our competitive  position, reduce our revenues, or increase our \\ncosts. \\n• We are exposed to risks related to information technology infra structure, information management and protection, \\ncybersecurity threats, and cyber incidents. \\n• We and our customers are subject to laws and regulations concer ning data privacy, dat a security, consumer \\nprotection, and advertising and these laws and regulations are continually evolving, which exposes us to potential \\nmaterial risks. \\n• Our technologies could infringe the IP rights of others, causin g costly litigation and the loss of significant rights. \\n• Competition in the market for data analytics and related system s and services may intensify in the future, which \\ncould impede our ability to gr ow or execute our strategy. \\n• Generative AI and the user other advanced AI technologies for s oftware development may subject us to claims \\nof misappropriation of others’ IP, bugs/errors, and ambiguous o wnership of created content. \\nRisks Related to Our Operations \\n• Measurement of our variable consideration sometimes require dat a collection and customers’ use of estimates \\nand are contingent upon customers’ consent and may be later off set if actual data differ from customers’ estimates, \\nwhich can result in uncertainty a nd cause quarterly results to fluctuate.

      "9 page_content='Table of Contents \\n18 • We have customers with past due b alances and our failure to col lect a significant portion of such balances could \\nadversely affect our cash, require us to write-off receivables,  or increase our expense or allowance for credit \\nlosses. \\n• We face operational and financial risks associated with interna tional operations that could negatively impact our \\nrevenues. \\n• Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and pu blic disclosure regulations and expectations, \\nincluding with respect to ESG matters that could expose us to n umerous risks. \\n• Provision of certain of our da ta services relies on installing,  configuring, and operating proprietary configuration \\nof hardware and software systems located in third-party facilit ies and errors affecting such facilities’ operations \\ncould lead to liability for us, a nd any objection from such thi rd-party facility or delay in providing us physical or \\nlogical access to our systems may  adversely impact our ability to timely perform our contract obligations or lead \\nto confidentiality, integrity, availability, security, or priva cy controls exceptions. \\nTax Risks \\n \\n• U.S. federal tax reform and chan ges in foreign tax laws could c hange our tax burden and adversely affect our \\nbusiness and financial condition. \\n• Future events may impact our deferred tax asset position, inclu ding the utilization of net operating loss and tax \\ncredit carryforwards. \\nRisks Related to Our Strategic Transactions \\n• We may devote significant time and resources to developing stra tegic relationships but we may not realize the \\nbenefits of such efforts, which could have an adverse effect on  our business and results of operations. \\n• Our acquisitions create special r isks and challenges that could  adversely affect our  financial results. \\nGeneral Risk Factors \\n• If we are not able to retain, a ttract, motivate, and strategica lly locate talented employees, including some key \\nexecutives, our business may suffer. \\n• Our earnings per share and other operating results may vary qua rter to quarter, which could result in not meeting \\ninvestors’ expectations a nd stock price volatility. \\n• Our business could be negatively affected as a result of action s of activist shareholders, and such activism could \\nimpact the trading value of our securities. \\nRisks Associated with Our Business \\nWe have invested significant resources into research and development of our DFI system and Exensio software and if \\nwe fail to successfully carry out these initiatives on the expect ed timeline or at all, our business, financial condition, or \\nresults of operations could be adversely impacted. \\nAs part of the evolution of our business, we have made substant ial investments in research and development efforts \\nto develop our DFI system and Exensio software. New competitors , technological advances in th e semiconductor industry \\nor other competitive factors may require us to further invest s ignificantly greater resources t han we anticipate. If we invest  \\nsignificantly greater resources  than anticipated without a corr esponding increase in revenue, our operating results could \\ndecline. The technologies and products that we invest in may no t result in products that creat e additional revenue, and we ' metadata={'source': '/home/kings/7 projects/Tradingbot/data/finance_data.pdf', 'page': 19}\n",
      "10 page_content='Table of Contents \\n19 may not recoup our investments, which could cause our results t o suffer. If our DFI system and Exensio software do not \\nanticipate technological changes i n our industry or fail to mee t market demand, we may not capture the market share we \\nanticipate, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition \\nor results of operations could be adversely affected. Additiona lly, our periodic research and development expenses may \\nbe independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. \\nOur sales cycle is lengthy and customers may delay entering into contracts or decide no t to adopt our products or \\nsolutions after we have performed services  or supported their evaluation of our technology, which could result in delays \\nin recognizing revenue and could negatively impact our results  of operations in a quarter or result in lower revenue \\nthan we expected if a cont ract is not consummated. \\nOn-going negotiations and evaluation projects for new products,  with new customers or in new markets may not result \\nin significant revenues for us if  we are unable to close new en gagements on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner, or \\nat all. Unexpected delays in our sales cycle could cause our re venues to fall short of expectations. Further, the timing and \\nlength of negotiations required to enter into agreements with o ur customers and the enforcement of our complex contractual \\nprovisions is difficult to predi ct. If we do not successfully n egotiate certain key complex contractual provisions, if there \\nare disputes regarding such provisions, or if they are not enfo rceable as we intended, our revenues and results of operations \\nwould suffer. Further, our customers sometimes delay starting n egotiations until they begin developing a new process, \\nhave a need for a new product, or  experience specific yield iss ues. This means that, on occasion we have, and may continue \\nto provide technology and services under preliminary documentat ion before executing the final contract. In these cases, \\nwe would not recognize revenue and may defer associated costs u ntil execution of a final contract, which, if significant, \\ncould negatively impact our results of operations in the period s before we execute a final contract. Further, if we were to \\nincur significant costs and then fail to enter into a final con tract, we would have to write-off such deferred costs in the \\nperiod in which the negotiations ended, which would increase ou r costs and expenses and could result in significant \\noperating losses. \\nWe rely on sole-source providers for certain software as well as for specialized parts for our eProbe hardware and \\nsupply-chain delays or disruptions could increase our costs or impact our ability to provide complete software solutions \\nor to build additional hardware tools or meet customer exp ectations or deadlines, which could result in lost sales and \\nlower earnings. \\nWe provide some enabling technology under license and support f rom sole-source providers and some of our vendors \\nprovide highly specialized, differentiated products and service s related to our eProbe system. In the event these licensors \\nor vendors delay or discontinue providing such products and ser vices to us, it may be difficult and costly or impossible for \\nus to replace such suppliers or parts. In the case of licensed software, this could impact our ability to grow our sales or to  \\nmeet the support expectations of our customers and we may need to resort to legal action, which could limit our future \\nsales, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and harm our ea rnings. For example, in November 2023, a provider of \\nenabling technology abruptly stopped providing maintenance and support of their software product to us. As a result, we \\nresorted to legal action, which caused us to incur increased le gal expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. The \\nmatter is ongoing, and the long-term impact of this provider’s actions on our business and our customers is unknown at \\nthis time. In the case of vendors related to our eProbe tool, s uch disruptions or delays could delay or stop our ability to \\ncomplete and deliver our DFI systems as currently designed to o ur customers, which would negatively impact our bookings \\nand revenue related to such systems. In addition, such delays o r disruptions to our supply chain could significantly increase \\nour component costs, or personnel-related costs if we need to b uild a replacement solution in the case of certain software \\nelements, and could impact our ability to build future generati ons or models of our eProbe tools, any of which would \\ndecrease or delay our sales, earn ings, and liquidity and could otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased  \\ncosts. Such a delay or disruptio n could occur as a result of an y number of events, including, but not limited to: failure to \\ncomply with existing contracts, higher priority alternative buy ers, inflation and global interest rates increasing component \\ncosts, a closure or slowdown at our suppliers’ plants or shippi ng delays including, for example, those made to combat the \\nspread of COVID  -  19, market shortages for critical components, increases in pric es, the imposition of r egulations, quotas, \\nembargoes or tariffs on components or our products, labor stopp ages or shortages, our suppliers’ supply chain disruptions, \\nthird-party interference, cybera ttacks, severe weather conditio ns including the adverse effects of climate change-related \\nevents, geopolitical developments,  war or terrorism, and disrup tions in utilities and other services. In addition, the ' metadata={'source': '/home/kings/7 projects/Tradingbot/data/finance_data.pdf', 'page': 20}\n",
      "11 page_content='Table of Contents \\n20 development, licensing, or acquisition of new products in the f uture may increase the complexity of supply chain \\nmanagement. Failure to effectively manage our supply of compone nts and products could advers ely affect our business. \\nOur fixed-fee services for product or system installations/configurations may take longer than budgeted, which \\ncould slow our revenue recognition and may result in a lost contract or a claim of breach by our customers, which \\nwould negatively affect our financial and operating results. \\nOur fixed-fee services, includin g for Characterization, require  a team of engineers to collaborate with our customers \\nto address complex issues by using our software and other techn ologies, and the installation and configuration of our \\nsoftware into our customers’ fabrication and test/assembly faci lities requires experienced engineers working with our \\ncustomers on active foundry and test/assembly equipment. We mus t accurately estimate the am ount of time and resources \\nneeded to complete these types of services to determine when th e engineers will be able to commence their next \\nengagement. In addition, our accounting for contracts with such  services, which generate fixed fees, sometimes requires \\nadjustments to profit and loss ba sed on revised estimates durin g the performance of the contract. These adjustments may \\nhave a material effect on our results of operations in the peri od in which they are made. The e stimates giving rise to these \\nrisks, which are inherent in fixed-price contracts, include the  forecasting of costs and schedules, and contract revenues \\nrelated to contract performance. If we fail to meet a customer’ s expectations, the customer could terminate their contract \\nwith us or claim that we breache d our obligations, which could negatively affect our financial and operating results. \\nOur ability to sell our products, systems, and solutions depe nds in part on the quality of our support and services \\nofferings, and the failure to offer high-quality support and services could negatively aff ect our sales and results of \\noperations. \\nOnce our products are integrated  within our customers’ hardware  and software systems, our customers may depend \\non our support organization to resolve any issues relating to o ur products. Further, in connection with delivering our SaaS \\nServices, which requires us to maintain adequate server hardwar e and internet infrastructure, including system \\nredundancies, we are required to meet contractual uptime obliga tions. A high level of system and support is critical for the \\nsuccessful marketing and sale of our products. If we do not eff ectively provide subscription access to our SaaS customers, \\nassist our customers in deployi ng our products, succeed in help ing our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, \\nand provide effective on-going support and the privacy and data  security capabilities required by our customers, we may \\nface contractual penalties or customers may not renew subscript ions or services in the future, which would negatively \\nimpact our results of operations. In addition, due to our inter national operations, our system and support organization faces \\nchallenges associated with deliv ering support, hours that suppo rt is available, training, and documentation where the user’s \\nnative language may not be English. If we fail to maintain high -quality support and services or fail to adequately address \\nour customers’ support needs, our customers may choose our comp etitors’ products instead of ours in the future, which \\nwould negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.  \\nDefects in our proprietary technologies, hardware and software  tools, and failure to effec tively remedy any such defects \\ncould decrease our revenue and our competitive market share. \\nIf the software, hardware, or proprietary tech nologies we provi de to customers contain def ects that negatively impact \\ncustomers’ ability to use our syst ems or software,  increase our  customers’ cost of goods sold or time-to-market, or damage \\nour customers’ property, such defects could significantly decre ase the market acceptance of our products and services or \\ncould result in warranty or other claims. We must adequately tr ain our new personnel, especially our customer service and \\ntechnical support personnel, to effectively and accurately, res pond to and support our customers. If we fail to do this, it \\ncould lead to dissatisfaction among our customers, which could slow our growth. Further, th e cost of support resources \\nrequired to remedy any defects in our technologies, hardware, o r software tools could exceed our expectations. We have \\nand may further incorporate AI solutions and related technologi es for use in product development, or into our platform, \\nofferings, services and features, and these applications may be come important in our operati ons over time. If the content, \\nanalyses, recommendations, or o ther output that AI applications  assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, \\ninaccurate, or imprecise, our bu siness, financial condition, an d results of operations may be adversely affected. Any actual \\nor perceived defects with our sof tware, hardware, or proprietar y technologies may also hinder our ability to attract or retain  \\nindustry partners or customers , leading to a decrease in our re venue. These defects are frequently found during the period \\nfollowing introduction of new sof tware, hardware, or proprietar y technologies or enhancements to existing software, ' metadata={'source': '/home/kings/7 projects/Tradingbot/data/finance_data.pdf', 'page': 21}\n",
      "12 page_content='Table of Contents \\n21 hardware, or proprietary technologies, which means that we may not discover the errors or defects until after customer \\nimplementation. If our software, hardware, or proprietary techn ologies contain errors or defects, it could require us to \\nexpend significant resources to remedy these problems or defend /indemnify claims, which could reduce margins and result \\nin the diversion of technical and  other resources  from our othe r customer implementations and development efforts. \\nObjectionable disclosure of our customers’ confidential in formation or our failure to comply with our customers’ \\nsecurity rules, including for those related to SaaS access, AI  use, or our on-site access, could result in costly litigation, \\ncause us to lose existing and potential customers, or negatively impact on-goi ng business with existing customers. \\nIn the ordinary course of providing SaaS or other services enga gements, we may collect customers’ product, process, \\nand test information, personally-identifiable data about their employees needed to administ er licenses, and other \\nconfidential information. Our customers consider most of this i nformation to be competitively sensitive and, in some cases, \\nrequire us to comply with strict protection frameworks, includi ng security rules for on-site or remote access to, hosting of, \\nor transfer of their confidential information. As a result of i ncreased regulatory and customer scrutiny of all data processin g \\nactivities, as well as increasing and evolving regulation of su ch practices, we have security obligations on how we collect, \\ntransfer and use data (including personal data), which could re quire us to expend money and resources to comply with \\nthose requirements, and if compromised again, could have a mate rial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, \\nand results of operations, including the potential for regulato ry investigations, enforcement ac tions, lawsuits, and a loss of  \\nbusiness and a degradation of our reputation. If we fail to imp lement industry standard protections and processing \\nprocedures, the growing awareness of our customers and potentia l customers regarding privacy and data security \\nrequirements and/or adverse media  coverage or regulatory scruti ny could limit the use and adoption of our services. In \\naddition, to avoid potential disclosure of confidential informa tion to competitors, some of our customers may, in the future, \\nask us not to work with key products or processes, which could limit our revenue opportunities . We recently started using \\nthird party AI/ML systems for re search and development purposes . If these third-party AI/ML systems misuse or fail to \\nproperly protect the data we input, our use of such AI systems may result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive, \\nproprietary, or confidential information belonging to us or our  customers. For example, if the information we input into a \\nthird-party AI/ML system is used to train the underlying AI/ML models, such inputs could be revealed to others. The third-\\nparty AI/ML system may also provide outputs that appear to be c orrect but are incomplete, in accurate, or otherwise flawed \\nand may lead us to make erroneous decisions or recommendations to customers, which could result in harm to our \\nreputation and competitive positi on, customer lo ss, and legal l iability. \\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and a large percentage of our \\nrevenues from one customer, so defaults or decreased busine ss with, or the loss of, any one of these customers, or \\npricing pressure, or customer consolidation could signific antly reduce our revenues or margins and negatively impact \\nresults of operations. \\nHistorically, we have had a small number of large customers tha t contribute significant revenues. In the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, one customer accounted for 35% of our total revenues. We have in the past and could in the future \\nlose a customer due to its decision not to develop or produce i ts own future process node or not to engage us on future \\np r o c e s s  n o d e s .  W e  c o u l d  a l s o  l o s e  c u s t o m e r s  a s  a  r e s u l t  o f  i n d u stry factors, including but not limited to reduced \\nmanufacturing volume or consolidation. Consolidation among our customers could also lead to increased customer \\nbargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. Further, new business may be delayed or \\nprevented if a key customer uses  its leverage to push for terms  that are worse for us and we delay entering into the contract \\nto negotiate for better terms or decide not to enter into the c ontract at all, in which case revenue in any particular quarter  \\nor year may fail to meet expectations and our reliance on our r emaining customers could increase. \\nFurther, if any of our key customers default, declare bankruptc y or otherwise delay or fail to pay amounts owed, or \\nwe otherwise have a dispute with  any of these customers, our re sults of operations would be negatively affected in the \\nshort term and possibly the long term. For example, in 2023, 20 22 and 2021, we incurred expenses in the amount of $2.6 \\nmillion, $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related t o the arbitration with SMIC New Technology Research & \\nDevelopment (Shanghai) Corporation due to SMIC’s failure to pay  fees due to us under a series of contracts. In 2024, we \\nmay continue to incur substantial additional expenses related t o an arbitration hearing to resolve this matter. The loss of \\nrevenue from any of our key customers would cause significant f luctuations in results of operations because our expenses \\nare fixed in the short term and it takes us a long time to repl ace customers or reassign resources.

Key customers failing \\nto purchase, renew, or expand the number or use of such systems  on our expected timeline or at all will cause our results \\nto miss expectations. Also, if t he results of our DFI system, i ncluding new applications, are not as we expect, we may not \\nbe able to successfully commercialize this system or such appli cations on schedule, or at all, and we may miss the market \\nopportunity and not recoup our investment. Further, our eProbe tool could cause unexpected damage to wafers or delay \\nprocessing wafers, which we could be liable for, or which could  make customers unwilling to use the tool. If we are not \\nable to create significant interes t and show reliable and usefu l results without significant damage to wafers, our investment \\nmay not be recouped and our future results may suffer. \\nWe are required to comply with governmental export and im port requirements that could subject us to liability and \\nrestrict our ability to sell our products and services, which co uld impair our ability to compete in international markets. \\nWe are required to comply with export controls and economic san ctions laws and regulations that restrict selling, \\nshipping, or transmitting our products and services and transfe rring our technology outside the United States. These \\nrequirements also restrict domestic release of software and tec hnology to foreign nationals. In addition, we are subject to \\ncustoms and other import requirem ents that regulate imports tha t are important for our busine ss. If we fail to comply with \\nthe U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) or other U.S . or non-U.S. export or economic sanctions laws and \\nregulations (collectively, “Export Regulations”), we could be s ubject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including \\nfines for the Company and the possible loss of the ability to e ngage in exporting and other in ternational transactions. Due \\nto the nature of our business and technology, Export Regulation s may also subject us to governmental inquiries regarding \\ntransactions between us an d certain foreign entities. \\nExport Regulations are fluid, complex, and uncertain, and there  are ongoing efforts throughout the industry in \\ncoordination with regulators to revise, clarify, and interpret Export Regulations. The U.S. Congress and regulators continue \\nto consider significant changes in laws and regulations. For ex ample, the U.S. government is reportedly considering \\nwhether and/or how to impose restrictions directly on cloud-hos ted services and further restrictions directly on U.S. person \\nactivity. We cannot predict the impact that additional legal ch anges may have on our business in the future. For example, \\nin October 2022 the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS” ) promulgated broad, novel Export Regulations relating \\nto China that temporarily caused us to pause some deliveries wh ile we interpreted the application of the new regulations \\non our business, given current and evolving operations. Also, B IS has placed certain entities on its entity list (the “Entity \\nList”), which restricts supply of  items to or in connection wit h the named entities. Further, in some circumstances Export \\nRegulations require a license to export an item if the recipien t will use the item to design or produce an item for a Huawei-\\naffiliated company or certain oth er organizations on the Entity  List. These regulations can also require licenses for exports \\nthat involve Chinese military or intelligence-related end users  or end uses. \\nFuture changes in Export Regulations, including changes in the enforcement and scope of such regulations, may create \\ndelays in the introduction of our products or services in inter national markets or could prevent our customers with \\ninternational operations from de ploying our products or service s globally. In some cases, such changes could prevent the \\nexport of our products or services to certain countries, govern ments, entities or individuals altogether. Any such delays or \\nrestrictions could adversely aff ect our business, financial con dition and results of operations. For further discussion, see \\nItem 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Cond ition and Results of Operations.”   \\nDecreases in wafer volumes at our customers’ manufacturing sites or the volume of ICs that some of our customers \\nare able to sell to their customers would caus e our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue to suffer. \\nOur Integrated Yield Ramp revenue includes amounts largely dete rmined by variable wafer volumes at manufacturing \\nsites covered by our contracts an d, in some cases, determined b y the volume of an IC product that our customer is able to \\nsell to its customers. Both of these factors are outside of our  control. We have seen a significant reduction in our Integrate d \\nYield Ramp revenue in recent years and expect this trend to con tinue. Further, some of our manufacturing customers’ \\nbusiness is largely dependent on customers that use our manufac turing customer as a second or third source. If those ' metadata={'source': '/home/kings/7 projects/Tradingbot/data/finance_data.pdf', 'page': 23}\n",

Further, reduced demand for \\nsemiconductor products or protectionist policies like those ste mming from the complex relationships among China, Hong \\nKong, Taiwan, and the United Stat es has from time to time decre ased and may continue to decrease the volume of wafers \\nand, in some cases, products our customers are able to make or sell, which would also decrease our Integrated Yield Ramp \\nrevenue. Also, our customers may unilaterally decide to impleme nt changes to their manufacturing processes during the \\nperiod that volume is covered by royalty contracts, which could  negatively affect yield resu lts and, thus, our Integrated \\nYield Ramp revenue. \\nSince we currently work on a small number of large projects at specified manufacturing sites and, in some cases, on \\nspecific IC products, our results of operations have been and m ay continue to be adversely affected by negative changes \\nat those sites or in those products, including slowdowns in man ufacturing due to external factors, such as U.S. trade \\nrestrictions, rising inflation and global interest rates, or co ntinued or worsening supply chain disruptions. Also, if wafer \\norders from sites covered by our contracts are not secured by o ur customers, if an end product does not achieve commercial \\nviability, if a process line or, in some cases, a specific prod uct, does not achieve significant increases in yield or sustain  \\nsignificant volume manufacturin g during the time we receive roy alties, revenues associated with such volumes or products \\nwould be negatively impacted. This could significantly reduce o ur Integrated Yield Ramp revenue and our results of \\noperations could fail to meet expectations. In addition, if we work with two directly competitive manufacturing facilities \\nor products, volume in one may offset volume, and thus any of o ur related revenue, in the other facility or product. \\nWe acquired an early-stage battery-solutions provider and have been investing in research and development for new \\nproducts and services beyond our traditional semiconducto r focus, and it could take a long time to reach market \\nacceptance and recoup our costs, if at all. \\nIn July 2023, we acquired Lantern Machinery Analytics, Inc., an  early-stage company providing products and services \\nfor battery manufacturers, which is beyond our traditional semi conductor focus. We have also invested in research and \\ndevelopment to expand the application of our existing products and services to battery manufacturers. If we do not create \\nproducts and services battery manufacturers desire, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our solutions for \\nbattery manufacturing on schedule, or at all. In this case, we may miss the market opportunity, which would mean lower \\nsales than we expect, the loss of  our investments in battery ma nufacturing solutions, which would mean lower earnings. \\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business \\nthrough rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions, which actions may have an adverse effect on our financial \\nand operating results. \\nOur ability to successfully offer o ur products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, \\nforecasting, and management proce ss to enable us to appropriate ly scale and adjust our business and business models in \\nresponse to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions, wh ich has in the past and could in the future continue to \\nrequire us to increase headcount,  acquire new companies or enga ge in restructurings from time to time. For example, while \\nwe have increased investment in our business by increasing head count, acquiring companies, and increasing our \\ninvestment in research and development, sales and marketing, an d other parts of our business from time to time, at other \\ntimes we have undertaken restructuring initiatives to reduce ex penses and align our operations with our evolving business \\nneeds. Some of our expenses related to such efforts are fixed c osts that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to \\nfluctuations in our business or headcount. Rapid changes in the  size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including \\nsales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to d evelop and deliver products and services as planned or impair \\nour ability to realize our current or future business and finan cial objectives. Our ability to capitalize on the market \\nopportunity and achieve cost savings and other benefits from re structuring initiatives within the expected time frame \\nrequires significant management input and leadership and is sub ject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject \\nto significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, s ome of which are beyond our cont rol. If these estimates and \\nassumptions are incorrect, and we are unsuccessful at implement ing changes, or if other unf oreseen events occur, our \\nbusiness and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Such ev ents may result in restrictions, curfews, or other actions \\nand give rise to significant changes in regional and global eco nomic conditions and cycles, which may adversely affect \\nour financial and operating results. Further geopolitical uncer tainties, including relations between the United States and \\neach of China and Russia, between Israel and Palestine, social activism, economic instability, war, terrorism, or other \\ncircumstances that interrupt our ability to conduct business co uld cause damage to, disrupt, or cancel sales of our products \\nand services on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or vendors with \\nwhich we do business. Due to the significance of our China mark et for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in \\nChina, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the followin g: the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including \\nrounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing rest rictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-\\nAmericanism; escalating U.S.-China tension and increasing polit ical sensitivities in China; the effects of China \\ngovernment funding in the development of domestic solutions and  customer preference for domestic suppliers creating \\nadditional competition in China; and unexpected governmental re gulations and restrictions in China as a result of renewed \\nefforts to contain the COVID  -  19 pandemic, which could negativ ely impact our local operations . Such events could also \\nmake it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. In addition, territorial invasions \\ncan lead to cybersecurity attacks on technology companies, such  as ours, located far outside of the conflict zone. We do \\nnot have a business continuity plan developed to account for al l continuity risks (please see Item 1C. Cybersecurity for \\nmore information about our cybersecurity risk management progra m). In the event of prolonged business interruptions or \\nnegative broad economic and security conditions due to politica l, geopolitical events, we could incur significant losses, \\nrequire substantial recovery tim e, and experien ce significant e xpenditures in order to resume our business operations. In \\naddition, our insurance policies typically contain a war exclus ion of some description and we do not know how our insurers \\nare likely to res pond in the event of a l oss alleged to have be en caused by geopolitical uncertainties. \\nGlobal economic conditions or semiconductor market cond itions could materially adversely impact demand for our \\nproducts and services, decrease our sales, or delay our sales cycle. \\nOur customers are global semico nductor companies, which means t hat our operations and performance depend \\nsignificantly on worldwide economic conditions as well as semic onductor market specific changes. Uncertainty about \\nglobal economic conditions including war, terrorism, geopolitic al uncertainties and other business interruptions could \\nresult in damage to, disruption, postponement or cancellation o f sales of our products or services on a global or regional \\nbasis. Furthermore, tighter credit, higher interest rates, infl ationary concerns, large-scale une mployment, negative financial  \\nnews and/or declines in income or asset values and other macroe conomic factors could have a material adverse effect on \\ndemand for our products and services and, accordingly, on our b usiness, results of operations or financial condition and/or \\nvendors with which we do business. For example, the timing of t he build-out of the semiconductor market in China depends \\nsignificantly on governmental funding on both local and nationa l levels and a delay in this funding could negatively affect \\nour revenues. Further, any economic and political uncertainty c aused by the United States tariffs imposed on goods from \\nChina or enhanced U.S. export regulations relating to China, am ong other potential countries, and any corresponding tariffs \\nfrom China or such other countri es in response, may negatively impact demand and/or increas e the cost for our products. \\nFurther, the semiconductor industry historically has been volat ile with up cycles and down cy cles, due to sudden changes \\nin customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending,  which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand \\nfor customers’ IC products by consumers, inventory levels relat ive to demand, and access to a ffordable capital. As a result \\nof the various factors that affe ct this volatility, the timing and length of any cycles can be difficult to predict and could be \\nlonger than anticipated. Any of these events could negatively a ffect our revenues and make it challenging or impossible \\nfor us to deliver products and se rvices to our customers foreca st our operating results, make business decisions, and identify  \\nthe risks that may affect our business, financial condition and  results of operations.

If we or our customers are unable to procure required third-party programs that can be used in \\nconnection with our products fo r battery manufacturing, or the cost to do so is higher than expected, we may miss the \\nmarket opportunity, which would mean lower sales than expected,  or our costs may be higher, which would mean lower \\nearnings than expected.    \\nRisks Related to  Our Technology \\nIf we fail to protect our IP rights, customers or potential competitors may be able to use our technologies to develop \\ntheir own solutions, which could weaken  our competitive position, reduce our revenues, or increase our costs. \\nOur success depends largely on the protection of our proprietar y technology. Our contractual, patent, copyright, \\ntrademark, and trade secret prot ection may not be effective aga inst any particular threat or in any particular location. Our \\npending patent applications may not result in issued patents, a nd even if issued, they may not be sufficiently broad to \\nprotect our proprietary technologies. Some foreign countries do  not currently provide effective legal protection for IP and \\nour ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. Our trade secrets may \\nalso be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently dev eloped by competitors. Litigation may be necessary from \\ntime to time to enforce our IP rights. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights and incur \\nsubstantial unexpected operating costs. Litigation could also d ivert our resources, including our managerial and \\nengineering resources. If we are unable to exclude others from using our proprietary technologies and methods without \\ncompensation to us, through litigation or otherwise, it could i mpede our ability to grow our business and our revenues may \\nsuffer. \\nWe are exposed to risks related to information technology  infrastructure, information management and protection, \\ncybersecurity threats, and cyber incidents. \\nWe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure, as  well as the public cloud to an increasing degree, to \\nprovide our products and services to our customers. Additionall y, we must frequently expand our internal information \\nsystem to meet increasing demand in storage, computing and comm unication, which may result in increased costs. Our \\ninternal information system is expensive to expand and must be highly secure due to the sensitive nature of our customers’ \\ninformation that we transmit. Building and managing the support  necessary for our growth pl aces significant demands on \\nour management and resources. These demands may divert these re sources from the continued growth of our business and \\nimplementation of our business strategy. Bad actors may make in creased use of widely available access to generative AI \\ntechnology, such as ChatGPT, for  more sophisticated and frequen t cyber-attacks or fraudulent impersonations against us. \\nThese attacks could come from e ither Advanced Persistent Threat  actors or other individual organized or unorganized \\nmalicious actors.  The expense to purchase, update, and configu re security information system s to detect and/or neutralize \\nincreasingly complex and sophisticated attacks may increase our  costs and, failure to acquire the right expertise or systems \\nmay leave us vulnerable to attacks, which could expose our conf idential or competitive information or that of our \\ncustomers, which could expose u s to liability and have a negati ve impact on our reputation and business opportunity. \\nWe rely on third-party service providers to enable key services  to our customers, including for cloud services, \\nenterprise software, customer s upport portal software, and co-l ocation computing facilities. We have experienced in the \\npast, and may experience in the future, interruptions in our in formation systems on which our global operations depend or \\nunplanned downtime of the infrastructure that delivers our SaaS . Such an unplanned interruption, even if temporary, could \\nstop SaaS customers from accessing their hosted data or on-prem ise customers from downloading licensed software or \\ncritical security patches, or fro m accessing our support portal , which could mean that we may not meet our contractual \\ncommitments for such services to customers, which could reduce our revenue, incur liability, or result in damage to our \\nreputation and negatively impact future sales. Further, the inf ormation technology and infrastructure that stores and \\nprocesses our and our customers’ data is susceptible to continu ally evolving cybersecurity threats that become more ' metadata={'source': '/home/kings/7 projects/Tradingbot/data/finance_data.pdf', 'page': 26}\n",

We and our third-party service providers, with  whom we may share data, may be unable to anticipate \\nthese techniques or may not implement adequate preventative mea sures to prevent either u nauthorized access to our \\nsystems or services that could compromise customer data or othe r confidential information or result in a disruption of our \\nservices. In particular, like our peers, we are often the targe t of cyber-attacks by third par ties seeking unauthorized access  \\nto confidential or sensitive data, including customer confident ial information, or to disrupt our ability to provide services \\nfrom a broad range of threat actors, including foreign governme nts, criminals, competitors , computer hackers, cyber \\nterrorists and politically motivated groups or individuals. To date, we have not incurred any material costs from these \\nattacks.  The security measures we have integrated into our int ernal systems, SaaS, and software products, which are \\ndesigned to detect unauthorized intrusions or activity and prev ent or minimize security breac hes, vary in maturity across \\nour business and may not function as expected or may not be suf ficient to protect against certain attacks. Additionally, we \\nmay not have sufficient audit logs to fully understand the natu re of a cyber-attack.  In some cases, we do not have contracts \\nto provide legal protection or recourse for breaches of our sec urity protections, which may increase our exposure to \\nexpenses related to such attacks and negatively impact our resu lts. \\nRansomware attacks are becoming i ncreasingly prevalent and seve re, and can lead to significant interruptions in our \\noperations, loss of data and income, reputational loss, diversi on of funds, and may result in fines, litigation and unwanted \\nmedia attention. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling \\nor unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable  laws or regulations prohibiting payments. Territorial \\ninvasions like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or other geopolitic al events can lead to cybersecurity attacks on technology \\ncompanies, such as ours, located  far outside of the conflict zo ne. In the event of prolonged business interruptions due to a \\nsecurity breach or disruption, w e could incur significant losse s, require substantial recovery time and experience significant  \\nexpenditures in order to resume our business operations. \\nOur information systems are susceptible to computer viruses, cy ber-related security breaches, and similar disruptions \\nfrom unauthorized intrusions, tam pering, misuse, criminal acts including phishing, or other events or developments that \\nwe may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate. Our securit y measures may also be circumvented or bypassed due to \\nemployee errors or malfeasance. Third parties may attempt to fr audulently induce employees or customers to disclose \\ninformation in order to gain acce ss to our data or our customer s’ data, including account cre dentials, customer personnel \\ninformation, or other information. If we fail to have adequate controls or safeguards, the secu rity of our internal networks, \\nelectronic systems, or physical facilities could be compromised , which could result in significant legal and financial \\nexposure, a loss of confidence in the security of our SaaS and other software products, interruptions, or malfunctions in \\nour operations, account lock outs , and, ultimatel y, harm to our  business, financial conditio n and results of operations. \\nWe face information technology se curity and fraud risks due to continued support of our employee’s remote or hybrid \\nwork environment, which may creat e additional information secur ity vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any \\ndisruption in our information technology systems. Our increased  reliance on work-from-anywhere technologies and even \\nour employees’ expanded reliance on company-approved bring-your -own-mobile-devices may increase the risk of \\ncybersecurity or data breaches f rom possible circumvention of s ecurity and monitoring systems, denial-of-service attacks \\nor other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer v iruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, \\nmalfeasance, social engineering, deep-fake impersonations, phys ical breaches, or other actions. \\nOur insurance policies may not cover losses incurred in the eve nt our systems or data are comprised, and they are \\nsubject to retention amounts that could be substantial. Moreove r, we cannot be certain that such insurance policies will \\ncontinue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms , or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to \\nany future claim. \\nMany of our customers and our technical partners require us to complete annual vendor security assessments which \\nmay include a requirement to complete information security self -assessments, third-party assessments, or obtain \\nindependent certifications from standards organizations. Any ex ception of controls found during such assessments or \\ncertification, especially if published in a report such as for SOC 2 Type 2, may need to be disclosed to a large number of \\ncustomers and potential customers. Such publication of controls  weaknesses could cause customers to re-evaluate their \\npurchasing or renewal decisions, which could cause us to lose s ales and, as a result, have lo wer earnings than expected.

While such acquisiti ons offer strategic oppor tunities for growth and \\ndiversification, they also expose us to cybersecurity risks tha t may arise during the integration process and thereafter. \\nChallenges in integrating information technology systems and ne tworks may create vulnerabilities and expose the \\norganization to unaut horized access and data breaches. The tran sfer and consolidation of sensitive information during \\nacquisitions heighten data security and privacy concerns, poten tially leading to regulatory compliance issues and \\nreputational damage. Third-party relationships established by t he acquired company introduce additional cybersecurity \\nrisks if not properly assessed and mitigated. Moreover, cultura l differences, compliance obligations, and resource \\nconstraints further complicate th e effective management of cybe rsecurity risks associated with acquisitions, potentially \\nimpacting the organization's financial performance and reputati on. \\nIf we experience a security event , we may have to conduct an in vestigation and notify individuals, customers, partners, \\nservice providers and state, fed eral and local g overnmental aut horities and regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere around the \\nglobe.  Accordingly, security events could lead to significant costs and fees for legal adv ice, investigation support, \\nremediation, and result in legal risk exposure, damage and harm  to our reputation, and impact on our ability to keep and \\nattract customers. \\nWe and our customers are subject to laws and regulations concerning data privacy, data security, consumer protection, \\nand advertising and these laws and regulations are continually evolving, which exposes us to potential material risks. \\nWe collect, use, store or disclo se (collectively, “process”) pe rsonal information, including from employees and \\ncustomers, in connection with the operation of our business. Th e personal information we process is subject to an \\nincreasing number of federal, state, local and foreign laws reg arding privacy and data security, as well as contractual \\ncommitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply w ith such obligations may result in governmental \\nenforcement actions, fines, litigation, or public statements ag ainst us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could \\ncause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an ad verse effect on our reputation and business. \\nIn the United States, we are sub ject to numerous federal, state  and local data privacy and security laws and regulations \\ngoverning the processing of information about individuals, incl uding federal laws (e.g., FTC Act) and state privacy laws \\n(e.g., the California Privacy rights Act and the Virginia Consu mer Data Protection Act), marketing and communications \\nlaws, laws regarding credit repo rts, data breach notification l aws, and consumer protection laws, many of which carry \\nsignificant potential for activ e enforcement and penalties. \\nAbroad, our customers may be subject to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR  or similar local or regional frameworks that \\nimpose a strict data protection compliance regime. Our customer s may impose these obligations on us by contract, which \\ncould require us to expend resources to comply with those requi rements. \\nMore generally, given the rapidly changing data privacy and dat a security laws, regulations, policies and legal \\nobligations discussed above, and  because any current compliance  is subject to change based on this shifting and \\ninconsistent landscape, we could incur costs of complying with these laws and regulations, which in some cases can be \\nenforced by our customers, other private parties in addition to  government entities, are high and likely to increase in the \\nfuture, particularly as the degr ee of regulation increases, our  business grows and our geographic scope and member base \\nexpands. The impact of these laws and regulations may dispropor tionately affect our business in comparison to our peers \\nin the technology sector that have greater resources. \\nOur technologies could infringe the IP rights of others, causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights. \\nSignificant litigation regarding IP rights exists in the semico nductor industry. It is possible that a third party may claim \\nthat our technologies infringe their IP rights or misappropriat e their trade secrets, which has happened in the past.

If we are unable to innovate quick ly enough to keep pace with our competitors in \\nincorporating such technological d evelopments in our product of ferings, our business could be harmed. See the discussion \\nin “Competition” in Part 1, Item 1. “Business” section for more  information about our current competitors. There may be \\nother competitors of which we are not aware, and we may compete  with the products or offerings of our existing competitor \\ncompanies or additional companies if we expand our offerings th rough acquisitions or development. The demand for \\nsolutions that address the need f or better integration between the silicon design and manufacturing processes may \\nencourage new direct competitors to enter our market. Increased  competition could lead to increased pricing pressure, \\nnegatively impacting our revenues, or a decreased ability to gr ow or execute our strategy. Also, our current and potential \\ncustomers may choose to develop their own solutions internally,  particularly if we are slow in deploying our solutions or \\nimproving them to meet market needs. These and other competitor s may be able to operate with a lower cost structure than \\nour engineering organization, which would give any such competi tor’s products a competitive advantage over our \\nsolutions. \\nGenerative AI and the user other advanced AI technologies  for software development may subject us to claims of \\nmisappropriation of others’ IP, bugs/errors, and ambiguous ownership of created content. \\nUncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as gen erative AI content creation may require additional \\ninvestment to protect our proprietary datasets, ML models, and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which \\nm a y  b e  c o s t l y  a n d  c o u l d  i m p a c t  o u r  p r o f i t  m a r g i n  i f  w e  d e c i d e  t o expand generative AI into our product offerings. \\nDeveloping, testing, and deploying secure and reliable AI syste ms and tested software made using such AI systems may \\nalso increase the cost profile of our offerings. We would be li able for any inaccuracies or errors in software that we release  \\nthat causes downtime or other d amage to our customers’ faciliti es or production lines, which could greatly increase our \\nexpenses and decrease our earnings. \\nRisks Related to Our Operations \\nMeasurement of our variable consideratio n sometimes require data collection and customers’ use of estimates and are \\ncontingent upon customers’ consent and may be later offset if actual data differ from customers’ estimates, which can \\nresult in uncertainty and cause quarterly results to fluctuate. \\nWe can only recognize volume- or average selling price- (“ASP”)  based royalties once we have reached agreement \\nwith our customers on their level of yield performance improvem ents or ASP and quarterly agreements are sometimes \\nbased on estimates of volume res ults or ASP for each quarter. M easuring the amount of yield improvement is inherently \\ncomplicated and dependent on our customers’ internal processes and on certain non-public information that may not be \\ndirectly available to us. Thus, there may be uncertainty as to some components of measuremen t or calculation. Also, some \\nvariable consideration can be highly susceptible to delays in o ur customers’ measurement of key factors such as reporting \\nvolumes results and level of yield or ASP. Therefore, we may ha ve to estimate revenue related to contingent variable fees \\nor usage- or sales-based royalties prior to the receipt of perf ormance reports, such as royalty acknowledgements, or other \\nrelated information from customers. These estimates are subject  to judgment to evaluate whether it is probable that a \\nsignificant revenue reversal w ill not occur in future periods, which could result in our recogn ition of less Integrated Yield \\nRamp revenue than expected that may later be offset when actual  results become available if such results differ from \\nestimates. \\nWe have customers with past due balances and our failure to collect a significant portion of such balances could \\nadversely affect our cash, require us to write-off receivabl es, or increase our expense or allowance for credit losses. \\nIf our customers fail to pay receivable balances when due, our cash will decrease and we may have to incur additional \\nexpenses in an attempt to collect such receivables, to write-of f a portion or all of such receivables, or to increase our \\nexpense or allowance for credit losses. Our accounts receivable  balance, net of allowance fo r credit losses, was $44.9 \\nmillion and $42.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, res pectively.
